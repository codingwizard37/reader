      <p class="text-muted font-italic"><i>The Book of Mormon: Parallel Reader</i> is a project by me (Jake Searle), a computer science undergrad from Brigham Young University.</p>

      <h4>Inspiration:</h4>
      <p>I served a full-time mission in Berlin, Germany and while I was there, I met members and friends alike who spoke all sorts of languages. I myself tried learning Chinese, in addition to German to help these people learn the Gospel, and saw what a difference it made for people to understand something in their native tongue.</p>
      <p>While studying Chinese, I fell in love with the Chinese <a href="https://media.ldscdn.org/pdf/lds-scriptures/book-of-mormon/book-of-mormon-language-study-edition-34406-cmn_eng.pdf">language study edition</a> of the Book of Mormon and also <a href="https://thebible.org/gt/index">thebible.org</a>'s parallel Bible reader, from both of which I took some inspiration.</p>

      <h4>Thanks:</h4>
